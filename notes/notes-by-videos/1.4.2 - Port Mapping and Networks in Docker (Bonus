ignore the folders for Docker:
	create .dockerignore file in this directory and put the names of the folders to ignore in this file


+ explanation of the network.
	
	Lest docker-compose 2 containers we developed previously:

		Host port 5431
			container 1 (Postgres) port 5432 (mapped to port 5431 of host)
			container 2 (Pgadmin) port 8080 (mapped to 8080 of host)


	if we now run another container ingest_data:v001 within the same docker network
	we need to connect diractly to the container 1 on port 5432 (inside the network) NOT the host port


You may now access the Airflow GUI by browsing to localhost:8080
