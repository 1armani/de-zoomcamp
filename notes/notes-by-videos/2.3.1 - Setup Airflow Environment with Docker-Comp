Setup ariflow

	create a folder with Google auth file:

		 cd ~ && mkdir -p ~/.google/credentials/
		 mv <path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json ~/.google/credentials/google_credentials.json

	create folders for airflow:
		mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
		echo 'AIRFLOW_UID=50000' >> .env

		# on not MacOS systems we need to run:
		echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" >> .env

	download yaml file for airflow docker compose:
		curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.5.3/docker-compose.yaml'

	Basic image of airflow doesn't know how to integrate with GCP (OAuth). So we need to edit the image
		we use this docker file:
		https://github.com/1armani/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/2_data_ingestion/airflow/Dockerfile

		the ref for GCP:
		https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/recipes.html

		download GCP ready dockerfile:
			https://github.com/1armani/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/2_data_ingestion/airflow/Dockerfile
		add requirenments.txt file to install py libraries we need in the project:
			https://github.com/1armani/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/2_data_ingestion/airflow/requirements.txt

		set the following parameter to false in yaml file:
			AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES: 'false'

		provide envs:
		    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: /.google/credentials/google_credentials.json
		    AIRFLOW_CONN_GOOGLE_CLOUD_DEFAULT: 'google-cloud-platform://?extra__google_cloud_platform__key_path=/.google/credentials/google_credentials.json'
		    GCP_PROJECT_ID: 'dtc-de-383805'
		    GCP_GCS_BUCKET: 'dtc_data_lake_dtc-de-383805'

		error:
			Airflow:Docker-Compose:"You are running pip as root Please use user to run pip:
				https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72102582/airflowdocker-composeyou-are-running-pip-as-root-please-use-user-to-run-pip
			changed the dockerfile:
				added the string before installing requirements.txt:
					USER ${AIRFLOW_UID}
				and added the following before SHELL (downloading):
					USER root

		now we are ready to build the image of the service specified in docker-compose.yaml file:
			docker-compose build

		now we run init service to make sure everything is ok:
			docker-compose up airflow-init

		if prev command exited with 0 then it's OK and we run the whole docker-compose:
			docker-compose up

		check the status:
			docker-compose ps

		and go to the web adress of the airflow to check everything was installed (log: airflow/airflow):
			0.0.0.0:8080
